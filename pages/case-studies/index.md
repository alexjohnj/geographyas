In order to get a decent mark in Geography you _need_ to use case studies and examples in your answers. If you don't include them, you can't get high marks. Even if a question doesn't ask for an example, throw one in your answer, just to be safe. For many landforms, you don't need to name a specific example, just an area where you can find these landforms. For example, naming a specific pothole would be a bit silly, but naming an area where you can find them is quite sensible. 

## Rivers

### Case Studies

- Flooding in a MEDC [(Boscastle 2004)][boscastle-floods]
- Flooding in a LEDC [(Bihar 2008)][bihar-floods]
- Hard engineering project [(The Three Gorges Dam, China)][three-gorges-dam]
- Soft engineering project [(Restoring the River Cole)][restoring-river-cole]

### Examples

- Potholes: The Strid on the River Wharfe (Yorkshire, UK)
- Waterfall: Pecca Falls (Ingelton, Yorkshire)
- Braided Channel: The Tagliamento (Italy)
- Levees: Along the Mississippi River (USA)
- Oxbow Lake: Found throughout Cuckmere Haven (Sussex, UK)
- Bird's Foot Delta: The Mississippi Delta (USA)
- Cuspate Delta: Niger Delta (Nigeria)
- Arcuate Delta: Nile Delta (Egypt)
- River Terraces: Along the River Isis[^1] (Oxford, UK)

## Coasts

### Case Studies

- An example of cliff collapse and the effects of the collapse on the people living there [(Barton-on-Sea)][barton-on-sea]
- Hard Engineering Project [(New Brighton)][new-brighton-hard-engineering]
- Soft Engineering Project [(Thursaston)][thursaston-soft-engineering]
- An example of coastal flooding due to either sea level rise or a natural disaster [(Tōhoku Tsunami, Japan)][coastal-flooding-case-study] 

### Examples

- Headland & Bay: Swanage Bay (South East Dorset, UK)
- Wave Cut Notches & Platforms: Around Hilbre Island (North West England)
- Arches, Stacks, Stumps & Geos: Again, all around Hilbre Island (North West England)
- Spit: Spurn Head (East Yorkshire, UK)
- Bar: Slapton Ley (Devon, UK)
- Tombolo: Chesil Beach (Isle of Portland, UK)
- Halosere/Salt Marsh: Parkgate (Wirral, UK)
- Psammosere/Sand Dune: Formby Beach (Sefton, UK)
- Rias: Lim Bay (Croatia)

[^1]: The River Isis is actually the Thames. 

[^2]: Trust me, very few of these are easy to spell. Magdalenafjord, [Tysfjord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysfjord), [Hardangerfjord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardangerfjord), [Eyjafjörður](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur).
