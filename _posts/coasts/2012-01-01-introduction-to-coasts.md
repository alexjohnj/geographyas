A coast is a narrow strip of land where the sea meets the land. Coasts are divided into zones depending on what the conditions are like on different sections of a coast.

- *Backshore* - This is the area between the high water mark and the landward limit of marine activity. 
- *Foreshore* - This is the area lying between the high water mark and the low water mark and is often seen as the most important area for marine activity. 
- *Inshore* - The area between the low water mark and the point where the waves cease to have any influence on the land around them. 
- *Offshore* - The area beyond the point where waves cease to impact the seabed and in which activity is limited to the deposition of sediments. 

## Factors Effecting Coasts

### Terrestrial 

- Rock type of the coast. If the coast is made from soft rock, it will be eroded far more quickly than if it is made of hard rock. 
- Deltas form where rivers meet the sea, which will alter the shape of coasts. 
- Composition of rock layers on coasts will affect their shapes.
- Tectonics in the area will effect coasts. Earthquakes can move rock and trigger tsunamis, which can destroy entire coastlines.
- Mangroves and coral reefs can alter the shape of coasts as they slow down incoming waves, decreasing the rate at which a coast is eroded. 

### Human

- Ports, docks and transport can be constructed and/or used on coasts, thus altering the shape of coasts. Boats can destroy coral reefs and hence increase the erosion of the coastline. 
- Coasts can be used for recreation and tourism. The increased foot traffic and demand for certain attractions on coastlines can alter their shape substantially. 
- Humans can settle on coastlines. Often, settlements on coastlines will thrive due to their proximity to the sea for trade and tourism. 
- Global warming is altering the shape of coastlines due to the rising sea levels resulting from it. 

### Atmospheric

- Certain types of weather can effect coasts. High winds and heavy rain will erode coasts. 
- The Moon (and the Sun and Jupiter to some extent) effects the tides substantially, which can alter the shape of coasts.
- Temperatures alter the shape of coasts. 

### Marine

- Biotic creatures such as Coral alter the shapes of coasts for the aforementioned reasons relating to the rate of erosion.
- Waves, tides & salt spray all play their part in altering the shape of coasts. 

## Coastal System

Coasts are considered an example of an open system as they have inputs and outputs. 

### Inputs

- Energy is inputted in the form of waves, wind currents and tides. These will vary spatially and temporally (space and time, no not [*that* space and time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_and_time)).
- Sediment from other [eroded coastlines](/coasts/sub-aerial-processes/), rivers and [sub-aerial processes](/coasts/coastal-weathering-and-mass-movement/) will be deposited along coasts. 
- Human activity will provide inputs for coastal systems. 

### Processes

- Erosion, transportation and deposition all take place on coasts along with longshore drift, biological activity and wind transport (known as aeolian). 

### Outputs

- Landforms, sediment and the shape and position of the coastline are all examples of outputs.
