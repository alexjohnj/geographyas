The location which waves break at is determined by the state of the tide. The level of the tide (and the sea level) over short time periods is, itself, determined by the combined gravitational affects of the Sun and Moon. The Sun and Moon exert a gravitational pull on the Earth with the moon having the bigger influence due to its proximity to the Earth despite the Moon obviously being less massive (and therefore gravitationally weaker) than the Sun. The Moon is able to pull water on the Earth towards it creating a bulge which is known as the high tide. As the moon orbits the Earth, the high tide follows it. There are two high tides a day, one when the moon is "in line" and another 12 hours and 25 minutes later, when the moon is on the other side of the Earth.

## Tidal Range

The *tidal range* is the difference between the high and low tides. The highest tides are known as “spring tides” and they occur twice a lunar month (every 14 days) when the Moon, Sun and Earth are aligned to provide the strongest gravitational pull. The lowest tides are known as “neap tides”. These, again, occur twice in a lunar month when the Moon is at 90˚ to the Sun, causing the two bodies to cancel out each other's gravitational forces.
