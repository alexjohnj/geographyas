## China's One Child Policy

### History

- *1953* - First modern census takes place in China. The population comes in as 583 million. 
- Between 1953 and 1964 the population increased by 112 million as Mao Zedong encouraged larger families in an attempt to make China stronger. 
- Attempts to slow down population growth were started in the 1970s using the slogan “Later, longer, fewer”. People were encouraged to limit families to two children.
- *1979* - One child policy introduced. 
- *2010* - Population: 1.335 billion.

### Reasons for the policy

1. Combat population explosion.
	- Imbalances between population and available resources. China has 7% of the world's agricultural land and 23% of the world's population. 
2. To encourage economic development
	- Improving the standard of living for the population.
	
### Mechanisms

- Law introduced to limit the number of births applied to the Han majority (90% of the population) but not the ethnic minorities. 
- Cash bonuses, improved housing and free education/medical care if couples limit themselves to one child. 
- Free birth control and family planning advice. 
- Age limits and certificates for marriage. Couples would have to apply for marriage certificates. 
- Anyone housing more than one child lost benefits and faced financial penalties (generally 3× their salary). 

### Issues

#### Demographic Structure

- Future ageing population and high dependency ratios. 
- Shortage of economically active age group. 

#### Gender Structure

- Ratio of 117 males for every 100 females among babies from birth through children of four years of age. Normally, 105 males are born for every 100 females. 
- By 2020, an estimated 30 million men will be unable to find a wife and have a child earning them the title “Bare branches”.

#### Civil Liberties & Human Rights

- Women pregnant for a second time often coerced into having an abortion or sterilisation particularly during the early years of the policy. 
- “Granny Police” were recruited in settlements to spy on people in their community who might be trying to keep a pregnancy secret. 

#### Civil Unrest

- Opposition in rural areas, where stronger requirements for sons to work in fields, continue family name and look after parents in their old age, exist
- Reports of gender selective abortions, hidden children, abandoned girls and, in rare cases, female infanticide. 

#### Little Emperor Syndrome 

- Indulged and closeted boys who are often arrogant and lacking in social skills.  

### Future

#### Amendments

- In rural areas, if the first child is a girl then a couple can have a second child. 
- If the first child is unhealthy, a couple can have a second child. 
- If both parents are only children, they can have two children. 

### Success

- Total fertility rate has declined from 6.2 in 1950 to 1.6 in 2009, which is below replacement level. The rate of natural increase has declined to 0.5% from 2.2% in the 1970s. 
- Policy has met the most success amongst urban populations. It has been less successful in rural areas where families have continued to have 2 or 3 children. 
- It is estimate that without the policy there would have been an extra 400 million Chinese people born between 1970 and 2009. 
- The reduction in the rate of population growth during the 1990s was accompanied by a noticeable rise in GNP. 
- Greater equality for women as status is enhanced. Women are offered more opportunities for gaining greater knowledge.
