The United Nations describes migration as the movement of a person or persons from one place to another, involving a permanent (one year or more) change of address. Migration can be within a country or to another. 

## Why Do People Migrate? 

- For economical, environmental, sociocultural or political reasons. 
- Migration can be voluntary or forced, temporary or permanent, national or international. 
- Population movements are driven and sustained by potential push and pull forces due to an imbalance in economic activities and opportunities. 
- Push factors are features of the home area which creates pressure and so causes people to move away. e.g. persecution, unemployment & poverty.
- Pull factors operate at places outside of the migrant's home area to attract individuals to a new location. e.g. political asylum, a promotion, high living standards in another area.

## Consequences Of Migration On The Country Of Origin

### Economic Impacts 

#### Positive

- The area benefits from remittences sent home. 
- Upon return, migrants bring new skills to the country such as the ability to speak foreign languages.These new skills can help to improve the economy in the country of origin. 
- There is less pressure on resources such as food and social services such as health care. 

#### Negative

- Loss of young workforce; those with skills and those with entrepreneurial talents move, slowing economic development. 
- Loss of labour may reduce inward investment by private companies, increasing dependencies on government initiatives. 

### Social Impacts

#### Positives

- Population density is reduced and birth rate falls as it's the younger population who migrates. This can help ease overpopulation. 
- Remittances sent home by economic migrants can be used to finance improved education & health service. 
- Returning migrants increase social expectations for communities, for example, increasing demand for better leisure facilities. 

#### Negatives

- Marriage rates fall and family structures break down as men migrate producing a generation of single mums. 
- Lots of young people migrating out of the country can increase the dependency ratio. 
- Returning retired migrants may increase social costs on the community as support mechanisms aren't in place for them. 
- Migration of men and young families can cause a loss of cultural leadership and traditions. 

### Political Impacts

- Policies to encourage natural increase can be developed. 
- Policies to encourage immigration to counteract outflow. 
- Requests for international aid. 

## Consequences Of Migration On The Host Country

### Economic Impacts

#### Positive

- Migrants take up less desirable, menial jobs which natives would not take but need filling. 
- The host country can gain skilled labour for cheap. 
- There is a labour surplus; those with skills and education fuel the economy. 
- The “skill gap” in many host countries can be filled by migrants. 
- Costs of retirement can be transferred to the country of origin. 

#### Negatives

- Migrant children must be educated, they won't necessarily speak the native language of the host country. 
- There is an over dependency in some industries on migrant labour, leading to a lack of jobs for people native to the host country. 
- Much of the money earned by the migrants isn't spent in the host country and is instead sent back to the country of origin. 
- More people increase the pressure on resources  and services such as health care systems. 

### Social Impacts

#### Positive 

- The creation of a multiethnic society increases understanding and tolerance of other cultures. 
- There is an influx of new or revitalised services e.g. Kebab shops & Turkish baths. 
- People from other countries can encourage the learning of new languages, helping people develop skills for working internationally. 

#### Negatives

- The dominance of males is reinforced (due to the large number of male migrants), especially in cultures where women already have a low status. 
- Aspects of cultural identity are lost, especially in second generation children. 
- Segregated ethnic areas are created e.g. China Town. Schools become dominated by migrant children. 

### Political Impacts

- Discrimination agains ethnic groups & minorities which can lead to civil unrest and extremism. 
- Calls for control on immigration. 
- Entrenchment of attitudes which may encourage fundamentalism. 

## Immigration Control

### On The Mexico - USA Border

- 9,150 border control agents. 
- Use of electronic equipment such as heat sensors, night vision goggles, air vehicles & Black Hawk helicopters. 
- Multiple operations to keep mexican immigrants out; Operation Rio Grande in the El Paso; Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego; Operation Hold-The-Line in El Paso; and operation safeguard in Tucson. 

### In Other Areas

- Limiting the number of migrant workers at the source.
- Insisting on boundary arrangements. 
- Preventing illegal crossings e.g. Sea patrols between Florida and Cuba. 
- Returning ineligible asylum seekers. 
- Use of holding bases for visa checks.
